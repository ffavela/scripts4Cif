Make sure you are using python 3.3 or later.The dependencies are
python3-numpy, python3-gemmi, python3-matplotlib, python3-pymatgen
(more to be written).

To install;

1) mkdir -p ~/.myPrograms
2) cd ~/.myPrograms
3) ln -s route/to/scripts4Cif/cif2Csv.py cif2Csv #PAY ATTENTION HERE!
4) Add the following line at the end of your .bashrc (or .zshrc ...):

             export PATH=$PATH:~/.myPrograms

Any new terminal (or after sourcing the current one) should be able to
run it.

If you want to also install the multiCODCsv script (located inside the
bashScripts dir) then just do steps 2 and 3 correspondingly.
