The dependencies are... (to be written!)

To install;

1) mkdir -p ~/.myPrograms
2) cd ~/.myPrograms
3) ln -s route/for/scripts4Cif/cif2Csv.py cif2Csv
4) Add the following line at the end of your .bashrc (or .zshrc ...):

             export PATH=$PATH:~/.myPrograms

Any new terminal (or after sourcing the current one) should be able to
run it.
